# [WIP] Sleekr Style Guide
Styleguide for Sleekr Engineering team

## General Rules

### Readability / Expressiveness Comes First
It's okay if you have many methods or long variable name as long as it's more readable / expressive.

### Keep IT Simple, Stupid / KISS
The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. If you only use a method or function than you don't need to import whole library.

### Always Follow YAGNI Principle
You aren't gonna need it / YAGNI a principle that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary. When coding don't think too much about the future feature. Just focus with current feature. It will prevent our code base too complex in early development.

### Don't Forget About Performance
After refactoring or implementing a feature, don't forget to monitor the performance.
